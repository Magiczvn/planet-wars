This is a somewhat cleaned up version of bocsimacko-b0.83, my final
submission to the Google AI Planet Wars Challenge [1].

* To get a binary

1. install ACL or SBCL
2. do './configure --lisp acl' or './configure --lisp sbcl'
3. make

* To understand the code 

In src/ read model.lisp, player.lisp and maybe alpha-beta.lisp. The
rest is plumbing and small third party libs (alexandria,
parse-number).
